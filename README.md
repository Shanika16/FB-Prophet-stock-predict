Problem Statement

The problem is to develop a stock price prediction model for Workday Inc. (WDAY) using Facebook Prophet, a time series forecasting tool. Workday is a cloud-based software company, and accurately predicting its stock prices can provide valuable insights for investors and traders. This project aims to create a reliable and robust predictive model to forecast Workday's stock prices.

Solution
I am using Prophet software to make the prediction. Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.

The proposed solution involves creating a predictive model for Workday Inc. (WDAY) stock prices using Facebook Prophet.
